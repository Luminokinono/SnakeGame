# SnakeGame
This project involves developing a 2D video game in C++ using the SFML graphics library. The selected game is Snake, a classic in which the player controls a snake moving on a grid to catch food that appears randomly. Each time the snake eats, it grows, making its movement increasingly difficult to manage.
